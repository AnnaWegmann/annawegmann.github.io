Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at the [NLP and Society Lab](https://nlpsoc.github.io/) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) with [Dong Nguyen](https://dongnguyen.nl/). I study social phenomena via natural language processing (NLP) methods. I focus on the analysis of (online) conversations. Previously, I completed my master's and bachelor's degree at RWTH Aachen University in computer science and mathematics  respectively.

I am studying conversations. Questions I am interested in include: Do people talk in a, to them, specific *style*? If so, can we use this to verify whether two utterances have been written by the same person (e.g., [Style Change Detection](https://pan.webis.de/clef20/pan20-web/style-change-detection.html))? How does speaking style change, e.g., over the course of a conversation (see *linguistic accommodation*) or given different situations? How does style correlate with "conversation quality"? What even is a good conversation? etc. 

Conversation topics I am especially interested in are those where the participating parties have conflicting interests. This can be topics like climate change, pensions or the corona virus.

**Interested in doing a Bachelor's or Master's Thesis with me?** Great. Please contact me via my uu mail. : )  
 Current topics I would find interesting to develop further with you are:  
 * Conversation quality (see, e.g., [Conversations gone awry](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/P18-1125/))  
    * Intimacy (e.g., see [Quantifiying Intimacy in Language](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.emnlp-main.428/)) -- Questions could include "Does intimacy improve a conversation?", "In which conversation do people show intimacy?"  
    * politeness  
    * empathy  
    * flow -- How to measure "conversational flow"?  
    * linguistic accommodation  
 * Conflict conversations -- Detection, Resolving, Strategies (e.g., see [Conversational Receptiveness](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.obhdp.2020.03.011))
 * Intrinsic plagiarism detection (see, e.g. [Is writing style predicitve of scientific fraud?](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W17-4905/)) -- Topics could be about improving detection algorithms, finding features relating to fraud, finding areas that are especially susceptible to fraud, ...  
 * Gender Bias in Fiction (e.g., [Analyzing Gender Bias within Narrative Tropes](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/2020.nlpcss-1.23.pdf)) -- How does popular culture influence popular belief?

I will present our paper [Does It Capture STEL? A Modular, Similarity-based Linguistic Style Evaluation Framework](https://arxiv.org/abs/2109.04817) at [EMNLP 2021](https://2021.emnlp.org/). 
I presented our paper  ["Detecting Different Forms of Semantic Shift in Word Embeddings via Paradigmatic and Syntagmatic Association Changes"](https://annawegmann.github.io/pdf/Detecting-Different-Forms-of-Semantic-Shift.pdf) at the [International Semantic Web Conference 2020](https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/).
