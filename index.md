**TL;DR: PhD Candidate, Natural Language Processing, Computational Social Science, Language and Society, Language Variation, Facilitating Political Discourse, Looking for Internships!**

I am a PhD Candidate at the [NLP and Society Lab](https://nlpsoc.github.io/) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) with [Dong Nguyen](https://dongnguyen.nl/). I study social phenomena via natural language processing (NLP) methods using (mostly) social media data. Previously, I studied computer science and mathematics at RWTH Aachen University.

I am interested in how people talk and how they talk with each other. For example, I studied language variation (e.g., how people say something as opposed to what they say) and online discussions.

I presented our paper on [Content-Independent Style Representations](https://aclanthology.org/2022.repl4nlp-1.26/) at RepL4NLP co-located with ACL 2022. See the video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QHW7pfwJ56E). We put our style embedding model for everyone to use [on the huggingface model hub](https://huggingface.co/AnnaWegmann/Style-Embedding) (see also pic below). This is work building on [Does It Capture STEL? A Modular, Similarity-based Linguistic Style Evaluation Framework](https://aclanthology.org/2021.emnlp-main.569/), our 2021 EMNLP paper (video [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WPbxyOrDK6w)).
