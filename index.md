Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at the [NLP and Society Lab](https://nlpsoc.github.io/) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) with [Dong Nguyen](https://dongnguyen.nl/). Previously, I completed my master's and bachelor's degree in computer science and mathematics at RWTH Aachen University respectively. Currently, I am working on conversational style analysis.

I am presenting the work done during my master's thesis with Prof. Markus Strohmaier at the CSSH group at RWTH Aachen University at the international semantic web conference.
