Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at the [NLP and Society Lab](https://nlpsoc.github.io/) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) with [Dong Nguyen](https://dongnguyen.nl/). Previously, I completed my master's and bachelor's degree at RWTH Aachen University in computer science and mathematics  respectively. Currently, I am focusing on conversational style analysis.

You can meet me at the [International Semantic Web Conference 2020](https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/) in November, where I am presenting our paper ["Detecting Different Forms of Semantic Shift in Word Embeddings via Paradigmatic and Syntagmatic Association Changes"](https://annawegmann.github.io/pdf/Detecting-Different-Forms-of-Semantic-Shift.pdf). The research for this paper was done during my master's thesis with [Markus Strohmaier](http://www.markusstrohmaier.info/) and [Florian Lemmerich](http://florian.lemmerich.net/) at the [CSSH](http://cssh.rwth-aachen.de/) group at [RWTH Aachen University](www.rwth-aachen.de/).

I am studying the role of language in intergenerational conversations in online settings. I am especially interested in conversations, where the participating parties have conflicting interests due to their different age groups, i.e., are subject to an *intergenerational dilemma*. This can be topics like climate change, pension or the corona virus.



My PhD project is funded by [EMMA](https://www.emma.nl/) and [NWO](https://www.nwo.nl/en/news-and-events/news/2020/02/five-new-studies-into-digital-society.html). This is a collaboration with Dong Nguyen (UU), [Kees van Deemter](https://www.uu.nl/staff/CJvanDeemter?t=0) (UU),  Tijs van den Broek and Bianca Beersma at the [Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam](https://www.vu.nl/en/).
