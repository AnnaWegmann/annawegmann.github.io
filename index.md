Hi, I am a PhD Candidate at the [NLP and Society Lab](https://nlpsoc.github.io/) at [Utrecht University](https://www.uu.nl/en) with [Dong Nguyen](https://dongnguyen.nl/). Previously, I completed my master's and bachelor's degree at RWTH Aachen University in computer science and mathematics  respectively. Currently, I am working on conversational style analysis.

You can meet me at the [International Semantic Web Conference 2020](https://iswc2020.semanticweb.org/) in November, where I am presenting our paper "Detecting Different Forms of Semantic Shift in Word Embeddings via Paradigmatic and Syntagmatic Association Changes". The research for this paper was done during my master's thesis with [Prof. Markus Strohmaier](http://www.markusstrohmaier.info/) and [Florian Lemmerich](http://florian.lemmerich.net/) at the [CSSH](http://cssh.rwth-aachen.de/) group at [RWTH Aachen University](www.rwth-aachen.de/).

I am studying the role of language in online conversations about intergenerational dilemmas. The PhD project is funded by EMMA and NWO. This is a collaboration with Tijs van den Broek and Bianca Beersma at the Vrije University Amsterdam.
